FIX FOR 502 ERROR - MISSING BUILD
==================================

The error shows: "Could not find a production build in the '.next' directory"

Run these commands on your server:

cd ~/tool-thinker
pm2 stop tool-thinker
pm2 delete tool-thinker
npm run build
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save
pm2 status

This will:
1. Stop and remove the broken PM2 process
2. Build the production version of your app
3. Start it fresh with PM2
4. Save the PM2 configuration

After running these, check:
pm2 logs tool-thinker --lines 20

You should see "✓ Ready" instead of build errors.
