QUICK FIX FOR 502 BAD GATEWAY
=============================

SSH into your server and run these commands in order:

1. Check PM2 status:
   pm2 status

2. Check PM2 logs for errors:
   pm2 logs tool-thinker --lines 50

3. Try restarting PM2:
   pm2 restart tool-thinker

4. If that doesn't work, check if the app is actually running:
   cd ~/tool-thinker
   pm2 delete tool-thinker
   npm run build
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
   pm2 save

5. Check Nginx is running:
   sudo systemctl status nginx

6. Check if port 3000 is accessible:
   curl http://localhost:3000

7. If the app isn't starting, check the logs:
   pm2 logs tool-thinker --err

Common causes:
- PM2 process crashed after update
- Build failed or incomplete
- Port 3000 not accessible
- Nginx misconfiguration
- Missing environment variables

If still getting 502 after these steps, check:
- PM2 logs for specific error messages
- Nginx error logs: sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
- Make sure .env file has all required variables
