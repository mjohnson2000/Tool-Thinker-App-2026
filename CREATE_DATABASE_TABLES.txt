# How to Create Database Tables in Supabase

## The Problem
Error: "Could not find the table 'public.steps' in the schema cache"
This means the database tables don't exist yet.

## Solution: Create Tables in Supabase

### Step 1: View the SQL Schema on Your Server
Run this command on your server to see the SQL:

```bash
cat ~/tool-thinker/lib/supabase/schema.sql
```

### Step 2: Copy the SQL
Copy the entire output from the command above.

### Step 3: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard in your browser
2. Sign in to your account
3. Click on your project (should be the one with URL: dejhoudyhqjxbcnrixdd.supabase.co)

### Step 4: Run the SQL
1. In Supabase Dashboard, click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
2. Click "New Query" button
3. Paste the SQL you copied from Step 2
4. Click "Run" button (or press Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter)
5. You should see "Success. No rows returned"

### Step 5: Verify Tables Were Created
1. In Supabase Dashboard, click "Table Editor" in the left sidebar
2. You should see these 6 tables:
   - projects
   - steps
   - step_inputs
   - step_outputs
   - feedback
   - events

### Step 6: Restart Your App
After creating tables, restart PM2:

```bash
pm2 restart tool-thinker
```

## That's It!
After this, the "Failed to generate output" error should be fixed.
